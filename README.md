# pomotroid-wal.sh

This scipt uses [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) to generate a theme for the [Pomotroid pomodoro timer](https://github.com/Splode/pomotroid). 
The current profile works for me, but you can play around with the colors if you want to.

After the first time running the script, a theme called "Wal-generated theme" will show up in the theme-selection panel of Pomotroid. Once you selected the theme Pomotoid will remember this theme by name. This means you can regenerate a new theme using a different wallpaper, overwriting the old theme. Once you restart Pomotroid the new colors will be applied.
